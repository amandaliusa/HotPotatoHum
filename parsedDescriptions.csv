Much of modern financial economics works with models in which agents are fully rational, in that they maximize expected utility and use Bayes’ law to update their beliefs. Behavioral finance is a large and active field that develops and studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which makes it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which provides guidance for the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and consider a number of applications: asset pricing; individual trading behavior; the origin of bubbles; and financial crises. Instructor: Jin.

53, "En 85. Poetry Writing. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. When William Blake wrote “to see a World in a Grain of Sand,” he tapped into poetry’s power to model the universe. For instance, once we set up a simile between “world” and “grain of sand”, we can test this hypothesis of sameness. How is sand like the world? Where will the model fail? And what might that tell us? Imagery, sensory language, arguments, ideas, and verse form itself can lead poetry toward power and discovery. This pursuit can reach from the page into one’s own life.

58, "En 102. Origins of Science Fiction. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Most histories of science fiction leave out medieval literature entirely, and often much of the early modern era — and some even skip straight forward to begin in the 20th century. But many of the fundamental characteristics of modern science fiction in fact have their origins in much earlier literature. In this course, we will read several classics of modern science fiction alongside medieval and early modern texts, considering how and why science fiction has remained such a powerful imaginative form for so long. Modern readings may include Ursula Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness, Miller’s A Canticle for Leibowitz, or Octavia Butler’s “The Book of Martha.” Medieval and early modern readings may include Mandeville’s Travels; More’s Utopia; medieval bestiaries, lapidaries, and herbiaries; alchemical texts; Kepler’s Somnium; or Margaret Cavendish’s The Blazing World. Instructor: Klement.

59, "En 107. Medieval Romance. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The medieval term romanz designated both a language, French, and a genre, romance, dedicated to the adventures of knights and ladies and the villains, monsters, magic, and miles that stood in their way. This course explores key examples from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries, while also examining evolutions in the form. We will consider how romances figured love and desire as well as negotiated questions of law, territory, and cultural difference. Authors and texts may include Chretien de Troyes, Marie de France, Gawain and the Green Knight, Arthurian legends, outlaw tales, and hagiography. Instructor: Jahner.
"
60, "En 110. Sinners, Saints, and Sexuality in Premodern Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. What made the difference between saint and sinner in medieval and Renaissance literature? This class takes up this question by focusing on the unruly problems of embodiment. We will read across a wide range of literatures, including early medical texts, saints’ lives, poetry and romance, as we examine how earlier periods understood gender and sexual difference. Questions we may consider include the following: how did writers construct the “naturalness” or “unnaturalness” of particular bodies and bodily acts? How did individuals assert control over their own bodies and those of others? In what ways did writing authorize, scrutinize, or police the boundaries of the licit and illicit? Finally, how have modern critics framed these questions? Possible readings include Aristotle, Freud, Chaucer, Margery Kempe, Christine de Pizan, Sidney, Shakespeare. Instructor: Jahner.
"
61, "En 113 ab. Shakespeare’s Career. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. A survey of Shakespeare’s career as a dramatist. The first term will study his comedies and histories; the second, his tragedies and tragicomedies. Students will need to read one play per week. Instructor: Pigman.
"
62, "En 118. Classical Mythology. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Why did the Greeks and Romans remain fascinated with the same stories of gods and demigods for more than a thousand years? On the other hand, how did they adapt those stories to fit new times and places? Starting with the earliest Greek poems and advancing through classical Athens, Hellenistic Alexandria, and Augustan Rome, we consider the history of writing poetry as a history of reading the past; the course also serves as an excellent introduction to ancient literary history at large. Readings may include Homer’s ’Odyssey,’ Hesiod, Aeschylus, Euripides, Apollonius Rhodius, Ovid, and Seneca. Instructor: Haugen.
"
63, "En 121. Literature and Its Readers. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The course will investigate readers who have made adventurous uses of their favorite works of literature, from Greek antiquity through the 20th century. Sometimes those readers count, at least temporarily, as literary critics, as when the philosopher Aristotle made Sophocles’ Oedipus the King the central model in his wildly successful essay on the literary form of tragedy. Other readers have been even more experimental, as when Sigmund Freud, studying the same play, made the “Oedipus complex” a meeting point for his theory of psychology, his vision of human societies, and his fascination with literary narrative. It will discuss some basic questions about the phenomenon of literary reading. Does a book have a single meaning? Can it be used rightly or wrongly? Instructor: Haugen.
"
64, "En 125. British Romantic Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. A selective survey of English writing in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Major authors may include Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and Austen. Particular attention will be paid to intellectual and historical contexts and to new understandings of the role of literature in society. Instructor: Gilmartin.
"
65, "En 128. Modern and Contemporary Irish Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. The development of Irish fiction, poetry, and drama from the early 20th-century Irish literary renaissance, through the impact of modernism, to the Field Day movement and other contemporary developments. Topics may include the impact of political violence and national division upon the literary imagination; the use of folk and fairy-tale traditions; patterns of emigration and literary exile; the challenge of the English language and the relation of Irish writing to British literary tradition; and recent treatments of Irish literature in regional, postcolonial, and global terms. Works by Joyce, Yeats, Synge, Friel, O’Brien, Heaney, Boland, and others. Instructor: Gilmartin.
"
66, "En 129. Early Irish Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. In the most recent Star Wars films, the young Jedi Rey finds Luke Skywalker hiding out on a remote island covered with ancient stone huts. These scenes were filmed in a real place: Skellig Micheal, a medieval monastic site off the coast of Ireland. What was the culture that produced this beautiful and strange place like? This course will introduce students to the literature and culture of early Ireland. We will read about a great war waged by the warrior queen Medbh to steal a famous bull; accounts of travel to a mysterious otherworld in the West; the story of the transformation of a king into a bird, cursed to live in tree tops and recite verse for the rest of his life; vicious and entertaining satirical poetry; and intricate poems written by professional poets for their powerful patrons. All texts will be read in English translation, but this course will also include a basic introduction to Irish, the Celtic language still spoken in Ireland, and the island’s primary literary and popular language up to the modern era. Instructor: Klement.
"
67, "En 135. Dickens’s London. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Charles Dickens and London have perhaps the most famous relationship of any writer and city in English. In this course, we will investigate both the London Dickens knew, and the portrait of the city that he painted, by reading some of Dickens’s great mid-career novels alongside a selection of primary and secondary historical sources. We will think about the gap-or overlap- between history and fiction, the idea of the novelist as alternative historian, and the idea of the novel as historical document. Historical topics covered may include: the development of the Victorian police force; plague and public health; Victorian poverty; colonialism and imperialism; Dickens and his illustrators; Victorian exhibition culture; and marriage and the cult of domesticity, among others. In addition to written work, students should expect to be responsible for making a short research presentation at some point in the term. Instructor: Gilmore.
"
68, "En 141. Contemporary African American Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course will engage works of contemporary African American literature, including Ishmael Reed’s experimental novel Mumbo Jumbo (1972) and Octavia Butler’s time-travel novel Kindred (1979) and selected Afrofuturist short stories. We will read critical essays about temporality and consider these authors’ use of temporal strategies, including anachronisms, non-linear narration, historiography, and the creation of speculative worlds. How does the artistic project of narrating the racialized past create possibilities for imagining alternative futures? The course will analyze the role of slavery, trauma, and collective memory in our readings, and it will set these literary texts in conversation with Afrofuturist music and visual culture from the 1970s to the present. Students will have the opportunity to examine archival materials from the Huntington Library related to Octavia Butler’s published fiction Instructors: Sherazi.
"
69, "En 142. Post-1945 American Literature and ‘The Death of the Author’. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course will explore the ambiguous status of literature that is published in the wake of an author’s death. Should “unfinished” work be edited and published in the late author’s name? What if the author left behind no express wishes for her/his unpublished writing or asked that it be destroyed? Alongside such questions, we will analyze posthumously published post-1945 American literature’s formal features and its engagements with socio-political transformations related to race, class, gender, and sexuality. Course readings will include Roland Barthes’ “The Death of the Author” (1967) and Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” (1969), as well as posthumously published modernist fiction and poetry by authors including Ralph Ellison, Sylvia Plath, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs Instructors: Sherazi.
"
70, "En 150. Chaos and Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. We tend to think of literary texts as models of a stable poetic order, but modern and postmodern writers conduct increasingly bold experiments to test the contrary. This class explores how writers from the nineteenth century onward draw upon ancient and contemporary concepts of chaos to test out increasingly sophisticated models of disorder though writing. Readings to include Lucretius, Serres, Calvino, Barth, Stoppard, and Kehlmann. Instructor: Holland.
"
71, "En/F 161. The New Hollywood. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course examines the post-classical era of Hollywood filmmaking with a focus on the late 1960s through the 1970s, a period of significant formal and thematic experimentation especially in the representation of violence and sexuality. We will study American culture and politics as well as film in this era, as we consider the relation between broader social transformations and the development of new narrative conventions and cinematic techniques. We will pay particular attention to the changing film industry and its influence on this body of work. Films covered may include Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, The Last Picture Show, Jaws, and Taxi Driver. Instructor: Jurca.

73, "En/H 193. Cervantes, Truth or Dare: Don Quixote in an Age of Empire. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Studies Cervantes’s literary masterpiece, Don Quixote, with a view to the great upheavals that shaped the early modern world: Renaissance Europe’s discovery of America; feudalism’s demise and the rise of mass poverty; Reformation and Counter-Reformation; extermination of heretics and war against infidels; and the decline of the Hapsburg dynasty. The hapless protagonist of Don Quixote calls into question the boundaries between sanity and madness, truth and falsehood, history and fiction, objectivity and individual experience. What might be modern, perhaps even revolutionary, in Cervantes’s dramatization of the moral and material dilemmas of his time? Conducted in English. Instructor: Wey-Gomez.
"
74, "ESL 101 ab. Oral Communication and Pronunciation. 3 units (3-0-0); first, second terms. Communication and pronunciation in spoken English.

"
78, "H 111. The Medieval Church. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course takes students through the history of the medieval Christian Church in Europe, from its roots in Roman Palestine, through the zenith of its power in the high Middle Ages, to its decline on the eve of the Reformation. The course focuses on the church less as a religion (although it will by necessity deal with some basic theology) than as an institution that came to have an enormous political, social, cultural, and economic impact on medieval life, and for a brief time made Rome once more the mistress of Europe. Instructor: Brown.
"
79, "H 113. The Troubadours. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Our literary tradition in the West goes back to the troubadours, who were the first poets writing in a spoken language (i.e. not Latin) who have had a continuous influence ever since. Who were these poets, and why did what they created have such a decisive impact? Some have claimed that the troubadours invented our basic assumptions about the relations between the self and the world. Certainly they affected ideas about the status of women, since they sang of poets in service to their unattainable ladies. We shall examine the troubadours’ interactions with their religious culture, showing how they were affected by Islam and Christianity, and how in turn they helped prepare the early thirteenth century explosion of religious mysticism. Our aim is to assess their contribution to building the basis for modern culture. We shall analyze how these poets developed a unique concept of subjectivity that made it possible for the self to acquire emotional knowledge about the world. In turn, that emotional basis became a foundation for the self that acquires scientific knowledge. Instructors: Motzkin.
"
80, "H 114. Mysticism and the Self. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Creating the emotional self may have been as significant for the modern project as was formulating an appropriate theory of knowledge. One source for the modern conception of the self lay in the mystical tradition. We shall examine Medieval mysticism, beginning with Saint Francis of Assisi and continuing through the Dominican followers of Meister Eckhardt. We shall also look at the Dutch mystic Jan van Ruusbroec, and then turn our attention to the woman mystics, such as, for example, Marguerite Porete, Julian of Norwich, and Margery Kempe. Finally we shall examine the sixteenth century Spanish mystics, St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila. Our focus will be on the way these mystics think about themselves in relation to God. We shall try to find out whether the conceptions of the self in this tradition have anything to do with how we think about the self. Instructors: Motzkin.
"
81, "H 125. Soviet Russia. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Why was the Russian Revolution of 1917 successful? And how did the Soviet system survive nearly 75 years? These questions will be addressed in the wider context of Russian history, with a focus on political, economic, and social institutions in the pre- and post-revolutionary period. Subjects covered include the ideological underpinnings of Bolshevism, Lenin and the Bolshevik coup, the rise of Stalin, collectivization, socialist realism, the command economy, World War II, the Krushchev ’thaw’, dissident culture and the arts, popular culture, and Gorbachev’s perestroika. A variety of sources will be used, including secondary historical literature, fiction, film, and art. Instructor: Dennison.
"
82, "H 131. History of Extinction. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Humans are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction—the first to be caused by human activity. Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200 years, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learning about the extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our focus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch on other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and ways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live in this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what many or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will scrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will be. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view some extinct species behind the scenes. Instructor: Lewis.
"
83, "H 132. Humanistic Ecology. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Humans’ conceptions of nature have changed dramatically over time. Ecological systems influence human culture, politics, law, and many other spheres, and in turn, humans influence those systems. This class introduces students to the field of humanistic ecology—a discipline that looks to a number of cultural, political, historical and economic elements to better understand the role of ecology in a larger sphere outside of its scientific structure and uses. Humanistic ecology is designed to provide context for the study of ecology, and in a fundamental way, focuses on the appropriate role of humanity in its relationship to nature: what is ethical, or not, what is useful, or not, and a variety of other matters that should be considered when taking a fully three-dimensional view of ecological science. Instructor: Lewis.
"
84, "H 135. War, Conquest, and Empires. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will use historical examples of war and conquest and ask why some periods of history were times of warfare and why certain countries developed a comparative advantage in violence. The examples will come from the history of Europe and Asia, from ancient times up until World War I, and the emphasis throughout will be on the interplay between politics, military technology, and social conditions. Instructor: Hoffman.
"
85, "H 137. Criminals, Outlaws, and Justice in a Thousand Years of Chinese History. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course explores the shifting boundary between discourses of crime and disobedience over the last millennium or so of Chinese history. It offers fictional, philosophical, political, propagandistic, official, and personal writings on crime and those who commit it as a basis for a wide-ranging series of discussions about when breaking the law is good, when breaking the law is bad, and who gets to decide where the line between a criminal and an outlaw should be drawn. Instructor: Dykstra.
"
86, "H 138. From Sage Kings to the CCP: A Primer on Ruler, State and Empire in the History of Chinese Government. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course surveys a large sample of writings on the craft of governance from across the span of Chinese history. It offers students a chance to explore new and old perspectives on leadership, organization, discipline, bureaucracy, justice, and other classic themes of statecraft writings. These materials will be placed in the context of several shifts in and disagreements about the methods of governance in Chinese history so that students may reflect on the dynamic tension between theory, belief, intention, and action in dictating the way that individuals describe the state. Instructor: Dykstra.
"
87, "H 150. America in the 1960s. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. The course adopts a thematic approach to the “long 1960s,” engaging in depth with the political, social, and cultural trends that shaped the decade. Topics include the African American struggle for civil rights, the “urban crisis,” Cold War culture, liberalism at high tide, the Vietnam War, sexual liberation, the New Left and counterculture, as well as the rise of the New Right. Throughout, the course interrogates the privileged role given the 1960s in American history, questioning to what extent the decade marked a departure from the American past or a continuation of long-running trends. Instructors: Savage.
"
88, "H 151. The Long(er) Civil Rights Movement: From Emancipation to Black Lives Matter. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Taking historian Jacqueline Dowd Hall’s call to expand the chronology of the civil rights narrative rather generously, this course explores African American freedom struggles over a period bookended by emancipation and the Black Lives Matter movement. Through an analysis of a wide array of historical sources, the course will also examine topics such as Reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow, the Great Migration, the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Northern and Western segregation, and mass incarceration. Instructors: Savage.

90, "H/HPS 186. From Plato to Pluto: Maps, Exploration and Culture from Antiquity to the Present. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course covers a broad range of topics in the history of maps and exploration from Antiquity to the present. These topics range from the earliest visualizations of earth and space in the Classical world to contemporary techniques in interplanetary navigation. By way of maps, students will explore various ways in which different cultures have conceptualized and navigated earth and space. While maps emulate the world as perceived by the human eye, they, in fact, comprise a set of observations and perceptions of the relationship between bodies in space and time. Thus, students will study maps, and the exploration they enable, as windows to the cultures that have produced them, not only as scientific and technical artifacts to measure and navigate our world. Instructors: Wey-Gomez, Ceva.
"
91, "H/L 191. Perspectives on History through German Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Industrialization, economic growth, and democracy came to Germany much later than to England and France, and the forms they took in Germany were filtered through the specific institutional character of Central Europe. German-speaking writers and intellectuals saw these trends from the perspective of indigenous intellectual traditions, and the resulting collisions of values and priorities largely shaped European and American social, political, and literary debates for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This course explores these writings (in English translation) against the historical background of Central European society, focusing on particular works of Goethe, Hoffmann, Heine, Nietzsche, Kafka, Rilke, and Mann. Instructor: Dennison.

101, "HPS/Pl 138. Human Nature and Society. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course will investigate how assumptions about human nature shape political philosophy, social institutions, and social policy. The course will begin with a historical perspective, examining the work of such political philosophers as Plato, Locke, Rousseau, and Marx, along with such psychologists as Freud and Skinner. Against this historical perspective, it will then turn to examine contemporary views on human nature from cognitive neuroscience and evolutionary psychology and explore their potential implications for political philosophy and social policy. Among topics to be discussed will be the nature of human sociality and cooperation; economic systems and assumptions regarding production and consumption; and propaganda, marketing, and manipulation.

115, "Hum/H 11. Love and Death: Using Demography to Study the History of Europe from 1700. 9 units (3-0-6); first, third terms. Demographic events—births, marriages, deaths—have always been highly responsive to changes in the local environment. Decisions about when to marry, how many children to have, or what kind of household to live in have always been closely correlated to decisions people take in other areas of their lives and, as a result, can tell us a great deal about the economic, social, and cultural worlds people inhabit. This course examines differences in demographic trends in Europe across space and time, from 1700 to the present, as well as existing explanations for these differences, including political economic factors, social and cultural norms, biology and disease environments. Some topics include: the demographic effects of war, industrialization, and urbanization; changes related to the emergence of reliable contraceptive technologies; changes related to the expansion of economic opportunities for women; the effects of government policies on demographic decisions.

What does meaning in life imply regarding the metaphysics of value? What is the relation between meaning and welfare, achievement, and goal-directedness? What sort of activities, from work to leisure, can be sources of meaning in life?
